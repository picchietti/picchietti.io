Since 2007 I've maintained my own website. It started out as learning html via local files. In tech years, it has been a lifetime since then. I have learned a lot along the way, and I'm not close to being done.

A few things to note about this repository:
- You don't necessarily have all of the secret/config files to run this website in its entirety.
- I added git to this website before uploading it to github. A timestamped commit was made automatically every time code was pushed to production. This will no longer be done.
- The server-side was upgraded from php to nodejs when I switched from shared hosting to cloud hosting.
- During the tracking of this repository, the domain has been switched from jonpicchietti.com to picchietti.io. I no longer own the former domain.
